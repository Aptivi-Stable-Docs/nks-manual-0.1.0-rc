# üåè Language Studio

You can make your own language using the language studio, which allows you to make your own kernel translation strings file for your own custom language. You can usually use this program to translate the kernel to your own native language. However, translation takes a lot of time, so you'll need to have some patience and focus.

Once you're done using the language studio, it provides you with an option to save your translation work. Afterwards, you can use the language manager, `langman`, to load your custom language using `langman <load> <customlanguagename>`. Once your language is loaded, you can set the language to your custom one using the `settings` command.
