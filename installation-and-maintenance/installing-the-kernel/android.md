The tricky part is getting Nitrocid KS to run on Android phones and tablets, especially those that run the latest version of Android.

## Installation

To install Nitrocid KS on your phone or tablet, install the following dependencies:

* [Termux](https://termux.dev/en/)
* [Ubuntu PRoot](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/PRoot#Installing\_Linux\_distributions)

Ensure that your Android version is compatible with Termux. You need at least 8 GB of free storage and Android 7.0 or higher.

To get a better experience with Nitrocid KS on your phone or your tablet, it's advisable to get a phone or a tablet that supports desktop mode ([Samsung DeX](https://insights.samsung.com/2022/08/12/the-beginners-guide-to-samsung-dex-11/) for example) and a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard.

   * `apt update`
   * `apt dist-upgrade`
6. Install the .NET 8.0 runtime
   * `apt install dotnet-runtime-8.0`
7. Install wget to download the latest release from [this page](https://github.com/Aptivi/Kernel-Simulator/releases).
   * `apt install wget`
   * `wget https://github.com/Aptivi/Kernel-Simulator/releases/download/v0.x.x.x-beta/0.x.x.x-bin.zip`
8. Install unzip to extract the files
